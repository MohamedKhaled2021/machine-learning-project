# Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates building predictive models using Python. It includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the script to train and evaluate the model.

## Features

- Data preprocessing with pandas
- Model training with scikit-learn
- Evaluation metrics and hyperparameter tuning
